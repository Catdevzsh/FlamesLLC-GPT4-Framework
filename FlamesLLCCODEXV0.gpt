Prompt engineering is a process used to create effective prompts for Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. It involves designing and testing the prompt in order to elicit the most accurate response from an AI system, while also accounting for cultural context and user interface design principles. Prompts are typically created using natural language processing techniques such as sentiment analysis or text summarization, along with other linguistic features. The goal of prompt engineering is to ensure that AI systems can understand user intent accurately and respond appropriately in any given scenario. By optimizing the prompt, engineers can increase accuracy rates by up to 30%, creating more efficient processes that allow users to get results quicker than ever before
